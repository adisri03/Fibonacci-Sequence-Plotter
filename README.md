## Introduction

This Python script allows you to generate and visualize the Fibonacci sequence within a given range of indices. The script utilizes the Matplotlib library for plotting and calculates Fibonacci numbers using a custom function.

## Getting Started

1. Before using this script, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
      Matplotlib
      Plotly (for interactive graph options, though it's not currently used in the code)
      You can install these libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib plotly
   ```

2. Specify the range of indices for which you want to generate Fibonacci numbers
   ```bash
   fib_arr = []  # To store the Fibonacci numbers
   a = 0  # Start index
   b = 10  # End index (exclusive)
   ```
